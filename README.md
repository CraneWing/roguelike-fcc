# The Forest of El-Keim

This is a small, very simple roguelike with four levels created as a Free Code Camp challenge.

A roguelike or "dungeon crawler" is a game where an adventurer explores a series of chambers on each level, battling enemies for experience points, collecting treasure for value points, and food to restore health.

This roguelike is set in a forest, not a dungeon, just to be different. It is "simple" in the sense enemies don't spawn, move around or stalk the player.

All the player does to fight an enemy to walk into it. Treasure and food are scattered throughout the forest's "glens", as well as a single more powerful weapon each level.

These are the "user stories" this project must fulfill:

* I have health, a level and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.

* All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.

* I can move throughout a map, discovering items.

* I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.

* Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed. (Still in progress in this version.)

* When I beat an enemy, it goes away. I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

* When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based on my level and weapon. The enemy does damage based on its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
